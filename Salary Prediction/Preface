Salary differs according to a person's job profile. However, generally, it's the working experience that determines the salary. Salary prediction is a popular problem in the data science community.

Every company determines the salary of an employee according to the experience of the employee. Hereâ€™s a dataset based on the salary of people according to their experience:

YearsExperience: The job experience of the person in years.
Salary: Salary of the person.
As this problem is based on predicting the salary of a person, the Salary column is the target variable. Perform regression analysis to find the relationship between job experience and the salary of people.
